# LeetCode Bot ðŸ¤–

An automated bot that fetches LeetCode problems via GraphQL and generates solutions using OpenRouter AI.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ Fetches random or specific LeetCode problems via GraphQL
- ðŸ¤– Generates detailed solutions using OpenRouter (GPT-4o-mini)
- ðŸ’¾ Saves solutions as markdown files
- ðŸš€ Ready for automation and GitHub integration

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment variables:**
   The `.env` file is already configured with your OpenRouter API key.

3. **Test the setup:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

### Solve a specific problem:
```bash
npm start two-sum
npm start add-two-numbers
npm start longest-substring-without-repeating-characters
```

## How it works

1. **Problem Fetching**: Uses LeetCode's GraphQL API to fetch problem details
2. **AI Generation**: Sends problem to OpenRouter (GPT-4o-mini) for solution generation
3. **File Output**: Saves complete problem + solution as markdown files
4. **Automation Ready**: Designed for automated runs and GitHub commits
